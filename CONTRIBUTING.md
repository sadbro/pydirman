# CONTRIBUTING

## Issues
For any issues, create an issue and somebody will be assigned to see to it.
If nobody responds (which is super rare, hinting a slight flex on community),
please do not hesitate to [mail here](mailto:sadbro.linux@gmail.com)

## How to Contribute
There is a `contributing` branch in the repository. Fork it yourself and the codebase's yours to modify. All in all, have fun and at last do not forget to send a PR (Pull Request)
to the branch.
